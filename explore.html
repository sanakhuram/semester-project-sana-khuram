            Are you a young person looking to learn more about science? Come on
            down to our museum, there’s plenty to see and do. You can learn
            about Newtonian physics from our bumper swing, or why not travel
            back in time and meet our resident Woolly Mammoth? Our exhibits are
            designed to be accessible for interested minds, so make sure you
            come ready to learn and explore.

            We also have the Young Stars club which meets once a week on a
            Saturday between 10:00 and 13:00 where you’ll get to explore and
            experiment with our team of experts. During the school holidays we
            run special holiday clubs where you can join other children your age
            to go on a journey of discovery. Each holiday we pick a new theme to
            explore. To find out more about the holiday club and how you can
            join, send us a message.

            By becoming part of the museum's team, researchers have the
            opportunity to bridge the gap between scientific discovery and
            public understanding, translating complex concepts into accessible
            and engaging experiences. Through collaborative projects,
            researchers can leverage the museum's resources and
            interdisciplinary networks to explore diverse research avenues,
            conduct experiments, and contribute to the development of
            interactive exhibits and educational programs.
