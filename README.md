Welcome to the official repository for the Community Science Museum website project, designed for primary and middle school children (ages 7-15) and their families. This project is part of my first semester exam brief and focuses on building a modern, accessible, and responsive web presence for an interactive science museum.

## Description

This project aims to create an engaging, user-friendly website for the Community Science Museum. The website is designed to excite and entice children and families to visit the museum while maintaining a professional and educational tone.

The project includes:
- A home page that showcases key information and impactful imagery
- A contact page with essential information (address, phone, hours) and a contact form
- A contribution page detailing how to support the museum
- An exhibitions page featuring upcoming events and exhibits
- A privacy policy page outlining data protection practices
- A terms and conditions page

### Core Features
- **Responsive Design:** The website is optimized for mobile, tablet, and large screens.
- **Accessibility:** Built with inclusive design principles, ensuring usability for users with disabilities.
- **Cross-browser Compatibility:** Ensuring the site works seamlessly across major browsers.
- **No Frameworks:** CSS frameworks are avoided to meet the project’s requirements.
  
## Built With

- **HTML5:** For semantic and accessible structure.
- **CSS3:** To ensure responsive and appealing designs.
- **Figma:** Used for creating the style guide and high-fidelity wireframes.
- **GitHub Pages:** For project deployment and preview.
- **GitHub Projects:** For project management via a Kanban board.

## Getting Started

### Installing

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/community-science-museum.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd community-science-museum
   ```

### Running

Since the project is built with HTML and CSS (no JavaScript or complex build processes), you can simply open the `index.html` file in your browser to view the website locally.

1. Open the project folder and click on `index.html` or drag it into your browser.
   
Alternatively, you can serve the site using a simple HTTP server for a more professional development setup:

```bash
npx serve
```
