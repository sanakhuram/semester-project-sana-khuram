      <h1>About Us</h1>
      <p>
        Come join us at the Community Science Museum where we are committed to
        making science accessible to all. Over the course of human history,
        science has developed from our early understanding of fire, wind,
        water, and earth to exploring everything from galaxies far away to the
        very building blocks of life itself. The aim of our museum is to
        create a space where everyone can experience the wonders of our
        discoveries and perhaps even ignite a lifelong passion to continue the
        exploration of the world around us. We believe science should not be
        confined to the textbook, but brought to live through exhibits. This
        is why we have over 1000 different exhibits on the many varied
        subjects of science to explore. Many of these exhibits are designed
        for you to interact with and play around to see science come to life
        (apart from the dinosaur exhibits – they only come to life at night
        when everyone’s gone home).

        <h3>Support</h3>
        <p>
          There are various ways you can support the museum. Donations are
          very welcome and are an important way we keep this museum open and
          accessible to the whole community. You can also support us by
          donating items of interest to the museum’s collections. If you have
          some item or collection that you think others would enjoy, please

          be able to assist you.

        <h3>Volunteer</h3>
        <p>
          A number of people volunteer their time and effort to keep the
          displays in good order and ready for visitors to come and enjoy.
          Volunteering has its perks including getting to see behind the
          scenes of a working museum, access to staff-only lectures, and a
          monthly lunch where all staff and volunteers come together to
          discuss ideas for future exhibits and strategies for the museum. You
          can help volunteer in a number of different spheres. Please contact
          us if you would like to find out more about how you can get
          involved.
