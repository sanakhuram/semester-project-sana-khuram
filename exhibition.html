            Welcome to the Information Revolution, where robotics and artificial
            intelligence (AI) stand as the forefront of technological
            advancement. As we delve deeper into this era, we witness the
            seamless integration of AI into our daily lives, from smart home
            applications to the expansive industrial applications of robotics.
            Indeed, the future has arrived, presenting boundless possibilities
            and transformative innovations. The information revolution is here
            and robotics and artificial intelligence are the science of the
            future. From useful home applications of AI to industrial uses of
            robotics, the future is here. You can even say hello and shake the
            hand of Rob the Robot. An AI and robotics exhibition space serves as
            a platform for exploration, innovation, and dialogue, inspiring
            curiosity and encouraging visitors to contemplate the profound
            impact of AI and robotics on the way we live, work, and interact
            with the world.

            From micro-organisms to the human body, major breakthroughs in
            biology are offering us unique insights into the great wonders of
            the tiny world. For many people their life expectancy is much longer
            and their quality of life much improved, thanks to the growth of our
            understanding of medicine. Over a series of exhibits we explore the
            history of medicine and take a look at some major breakthroughs
            including the discovery of penicillin and the first heart
            transplant. Many of our great medicinal discoveries have come not
            only from the lab, but also from observing animals in the wild.
            Often our fellow creatures have beat us to it. Our main aims to
            educate, inspire curiosity, and raise awareness about the
            complexities of life sciences and healthcare, empowering visitors to
            make informed decisions about their health and well-being.

          <p>
            For centuries, philosophers and scientists have wrestled with the
            question of our origins. Where do we come from and how did we get
            here? Since Darwin proposed his theory of evolution we have had a
            framework for exploring and understanding our place in this world.
            Discover the origins of life on this planet and how the species we
            know today have evolved our time. You can also take some time to
            meet a few of the creatures who did not survive, including our Woolly
            Mammoth, the Dodos, and a number of dinosaurs too. As we peer into
            the past, we gain invaluable insights into the intricate web of
            life, marveling at the resilience and adaptability of living
            organisms across epochs and continents.

            As we learn more and more of the impact humans are having on the
            planet, the more important it becomes that scientists explore how to
            create a sustainable future not just for humans but for the whole
            planet. In our ecology section of the museum, we unpack the dangers
            we currently face including global warming, extinction of species,
            and pollution. But we also focus on the positive ways we can all
            contribute to a brighter future. In this section, we offer a
            holistic perspective on sustainability, emphasizing not only the
            dire consequences of inaction but also the transformative power of
            collective action. Museums often offer educational programs and
            workshops related to ecology for school groups, families, and the
            general public. These programs may include guided tours, lectures,
            and demonstrations by scientists and conservationists.

            Explore the wonders of our cosmos. Our fantastic exhibition, ‘The
            Sky Above Us’, explores the night sky and what we can see and know
            about the universe around us. We’ll locate the various
            constellations and galaxies that can be seen and learn a bit about
            the early navigators who used the stars to travel by. Follow the
            journey of our solar exploration: from early Arab traders, to
            Galileo’s telescope, to the latest exploration of the planets in our
            solar system.
