          Are you a young person looking to learn more about science? Come on
          down to our museum, there is plenty to see and do. You can learn
          about Newtonian physics from our bumper swing, or why not travel
          back in time and meet our resident Woolly Mammoth? Our exhibits are
          designed to be accessible for interested minds, so make sure you
          come ready to learn and explore.

          We also have the Young Stars club which meets once a week on a
          Saturday between 10:00 and 13:00 where you will get to explore and
          experiment with our team of experts. During the school holidays we
          run special holiday clubs where you can join other children your age
          to go on a journey of discovery. Each holiday we pick a new theme to
          explore. To find out more about the holiday club and how you can
          join, send us a message.

        <p>
          Are you looking to get involved with our team of researchers and
          academics? Our museum offers various ways for you to use our
          resources and contribute towards them. We have online records,
          laboratory space, and a working relationship with a number of
          universities around the country. Serving in a science museum allows
          researchers to inspire curiosity, ignite passion for discovery, and
          cultivate a deeper appreciation for the wonders of the natural world
          among visitors of all ages and backgrounds.

          By becoming part of the museum's team, researchers have the
          opportunity to bridge the gap between scientific discovery and
          public understanding, translating complex concepts into accessible
          and engaging experiences. Through collaborative projects,
          researchers can leverage the museum's resources and
          interdisciplinary networks to explore diverse research avenues,
          conduct experiments, and contribute to the development of
          interactive exhibits and educational programs.
